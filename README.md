# Context Menu Extension for Copying and Pasting Data

This project is a Chrome extension that provides a convenient way to copy and paste various types of data using context menus. It allows users to quickly copy and paste information such as job links, job titles, vendor details (company, name, email, contact, location), and LinkedIn profiles.

## Project Description

The Context Menu Extension for Copying and Pasting Data is designed to streamline the process of copying and pasting data from web pages. It adds custom context menu items that enable users to easily copy and paste specific types of data with a single click.

The extension creates two main context menu sections: "Copy" and "Paste." Under the "Copy" section, users can find menu items for copying different types of data, such as job links, job titles, vendor company names, vendor contact information, and LinkedIn profiles. When a user selects one of these menu items, the corresponding data is copied to the clipboard.

Similarly, the "Paste" section provides menu items for pasting the previously copied data into editable fields or content areas. Users can simply right-click on an editable area and select the appropriate "Paste" menu item to insert the copied data.

The extension also includes a "Reset All Data" menu item, which clears all the copied data from the extension's memory, allowing users to start fresh.

## Use Case

Here's an example use case that illustrates how the Context Menu Extension for Copying and Pasting Data can be beneficial:

1. **Scenario**: You're a recruiter or a job seeker browsing through job listings on various websites. You need to keep track of job details, company information, and contact details for potential follow-ups or applications.

2. **Using the Extension**:
   - While viewing a job listing, you can right-click on the job link and select "Copy Job Link" from the context menu. The job link is now copied to the clipboard.
   - Next, you can copy the job title, vendor company name, vendor contact information (name, email, phone number), and the vendor's LinkedIn profile by selecting the corresponding menu items from the "Copy" section.
   - If you need to paste any of the copied data into a document, email, or application form, simply right-click on the editable area and choose the appropriate "Paste" menu item from the context menu.
   - For example, you can paste the job link, job title, and vendor contact information into a spreadsheet or document for future reference.
   - If you accidentally copy the wrong data or want to start fresh, you can use the "Reset All Data" menu item to clear all the copied data from the extension's memory.

By using the Context Menu Extension for Copying and Pasting Data, you can streamline the process of collecting and organizing job-related information, saving time and effort compared to manually copying and pasting data from various sources.
